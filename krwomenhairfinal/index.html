This privacy policy is in effect for all websites owned and operated by the Company. By using any of the websites you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by the Company anytime you interact with the Company, when you provide it through various forms and places on the Websites such as in connection with a request or purchase of a product, service, or information or if you register for a Website account.</p>
<p>Your privacy is a priority at the Company, and We go to great lengths to protect it. You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Service, and by visiting or using our site and/ or purchasing something any of the offers associated with, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions.</p>

Please read the following carefully to understand how we collect information, including what type of information is gathered, how that information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.</p>
<p>If you disagree to these terms, please do not access or use this website.<br> The Company reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this Privacy Policy at any time in any manner. When we change the policy, any changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this website and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications.

<p><br> <strong>Information Collection</strong></p>
<p>In order to better serve you, we collect two basic types of information about our users: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized&nbsp; experience while using our Website.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this website, such as, ordering a service or making a purchase, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, or sending us feedback, questions or comments, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is totally optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name and contact information (e.g., mailing address including zip code, email address, telephone number) and other personal identifying information. When ordering services or making a purchase on the website, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity or you limit your ability to use all or a portion of the Website. In addition, if using a mobile device to access the Website, we collect the device’s Unique Device Identifier which may be considered Personal Information. In general, you may browse our Website without providing any Personal Information other than the Unique Device Identifier when using a mobile device.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. This information may include referring URL, your IP address, what browser type you are using, such as Internet Explorer®, Safari®, Chrome®, etc., city, time zone, and operating system such as Windows®, Mac®, iOS® or Android®. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Collection Methods and Use of Information</strong><br> We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: register on our website, register for our services,&nbsp; register your e-mail address with us, or making a purchase; sign up for special offers or promotions from selected third parties; send e-mail messages, submit forms or transmit another information by telephone or letter; or submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and/or services on our website. We may also collect information from you at other points on our website that state that such information is being collected.</p>
<p>In addition, we may also collect, or our server may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. In the event of third-party advertising on our site, our third party ad servers will also provide us with a summary, but not individual reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our site.</p>
<p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our website, improve our marketing and/or promotional efforts, statistically analyze website use, improve our product and service offerings, fill orders, and&nbsp; customize our website's content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this Private Policy.</p>
<p><br> <strong>Foreign use of the Website. </strong></p>
<p>To the extent that you are accessing the Website while domiciled outside of the United States, you acknowledge that the Personal Information you are providing Company is collected, transferred, processed, used, and stored in the United States, and therefore by using our Website, you consent to the transfer, processing of information to and storage of the information outside of your domiciled country and in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Release of&nbsp; Information</strong></p>
<p>Disclosure of Information to Service Providers and Third Party Vendors. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third party service providers and vendors in order to effect or to carry out any transaction that you have requested from Company or as necessary to complete its contractual obligations with you.

<p>We prohibit the sale or transfer of Personally Identifiable Information by such service providers and vendors.

<p>In rare circumstances, we may be contacted and required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate government authorities. We will disclose personally identifiable information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, and to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for fraudulent or illegal activities.
